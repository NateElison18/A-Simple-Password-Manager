# A-Simple-Password-Manager 

## Synopsis
This project served as the final project for the Object Oriented Programing 1 course at Southwest Tech (see OOP1 repository for the rest of the course work). As the title states, this is a simple password manager that users can utilize to save account information to an encrypted text file. The account information can be later be decrypted and displayed in plaintext to the user. The program can support multiple users. 

## Motivation
I put the project together to demonstrate what I have learned 

## How to Run
Explain what files are needed to run and which file to run. It is also helpful to include a screenshot of the program running. Make sure image is in your repository.
